## Welcome to the Matillion docs staging ground

Welcome to the Matillion docs staging area.

This statically generated website is created using mkdocs, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

Using this site, we can stage and preview pages, and share them with other Matillion colleagues without needing to worry about Document360's limited user count.

Stylistically, the site is a work-in-progress right now. But it deploys markdown pages quickly and allows us to provide public previews!

!!! Note

    This site is a work-in-progress, and should be considered pre-alpha at best.

??? Note

    You can collapse this note if you think it's not worth reading.
    Likely you already read it, though...
